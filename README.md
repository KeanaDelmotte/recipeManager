## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

2. **Set up your environment variables:**

   - **Google OAuth credentials are required for login.** You must provide `GOOGLE_ID` and `GOOGLE_SECRET` in your `.env` file. You can obtain these from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
   - **A NextAuth secret is also required.** Set `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in your `.env` file to a long, random string (you can generate one with `openssl rand -base64 32`).

3. **Set up the database:**

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
